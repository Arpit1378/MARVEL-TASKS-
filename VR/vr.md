**Virtual Reality (VR)** is a computer-generated environment with scenes and objects that appears to be real.
It makes the user feel they are immersed in their surroundings.
We can interact with these surroundings using special controllers.

**Augmented Reality (AR)**  is the integration of digital information with the user's environment in real time.
The key difference between AR and VR is that the VR lets us enter a whole new world and lets us experience it whereas the AR makes us experience the digital information into a user's environment.

Differences between AR and VR

| **Feature**               | **Augmented Reality (AR)**                              | **Virtual Reality (VR)**                             |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Environment**            | Combines real and virtual environments.               | Replaces the real world with a simulated one.       |
| **Hardware Required**      | Smartphones, tablets, etc. | VR headsets |
| **User Awareness**         | User remains aware of the real world.                 | User is isolated from the real world.               |
| **Immersion Level**        | Partially immersive.                                  | Fully immersive.                                    |
| **Interaction**            | Interacts with both real and virtual objects.         | Interaction is limited to the virtual environment.  |
| **Examples**               | Pok√©mon GO                                            | Flight Simulator                                    |

## **Report on L293D Motor Driver IC**

### What is L293D?

 The L293D is a popular motor driver IC used to control the direction and speed of DC motors. It features an H-bridge configuration, allowing for bidirectional control of two motors independently. This IC is widely used in robotics and automation projects due to its ability to interface with low-power microcontrollers and drive high-current motors.

### How Does It Work?
The L293D has **two H-bridges** inside. 
An H-bridge is a circuit that controls which way the motor spins by changing the direction of the current. 
We can use it to make the motor move forward, backward, or stop.

### What is an H-Bridge?
An H-bridge is a simple circuit that allows a motor to be driven forward or backward. 
It consists of four switches (transistors or MOSFETs) that can be controlled to create different voltage polarities across the motor terminals.\
It has four switches (transistors).\
By turning the switches on and off in the right way, you can change the flow of electricity to the motor.\
This controls the motor's direction.

### Controlling Speed: PWM
PWM stands for **Pulse Width Modulation**. It's a way to control how much power the motor gets. \
PWM is a technique used to control the speed of a motor by varying the duty cycle of a digital signal. By adjusting the duty cycle, the average voltage and current delivered to the motor can be controlled, thus regulating its speed.
By turning the power on and off really quickly:
- If it's on more than off, the motor goes faster.
- If it's off more than on, the motor slows down.

We can send these PWM signals to the L293D from a microcontroller, like Arduino, to control the motor's speed.

### Conclusion
The L293D motor driver is a robust and versatile IC that simplifies the control of DC motors.\
 Its H-bridge configuration and PWM capability allow for precise control of motor direction and speed, making it an essential component in many electronic and robotic projects.
